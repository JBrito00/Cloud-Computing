# Cloud-Computing

## Overview

This repository contains the work done during my Cloud Computing course at ISEL. It includes two main components: a lab project completed during practical classes and the final project of the course. Both projects leverage Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, utilizing paid accounts provided by the college for the duration of the semester.
